# Jimmy is Bored
## What can you do on this game, you may ask?

![](./resources/playerR.png)

This isn't a metaphorical game about love and passion, no.
It's a game about... Jimmy! The little protagonist. (the guy up there)

There is no plot. He is locked down in his room and you need to help him to entertain himself.
How can I do that? Well... the controls are simple.
- Move him around with the WASD keys
- If you see a popup appear, you can close it with the cross button or by pressing the "Sounds cool!" button
- You interact with objects by pressing SPACE. Each object has a different behavior and response. In order to interact with these objects, you have to make sure there's a highlight around them.

You may find secrets, you may not.

How do I run this game?
---------------
You may run the game manually, whereas you'll need Pyglet and to be in the main folder (jimmybored), where the Windows and Linux files are.
To run on Windows just download it and double click it, but for Linux run the following
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/webguy88/jimmybored.git
  $ cd jimmybored
  $ ./jimmy
```
Else, just download the Linux file and run it as usual.

So, have fun! :)
